# Hey there! :)

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I'm Caleb Kang, a Computer Science student at Harper College on track to transfer to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) through the Engineering Pathways program in Fall 2026. I'm passionate about building things at the intersection of scalable systems, AI/ML, and robotics to solve tangible, real-world problems.

## A Little About Me

I've been working as a Student Aide at Harper since Fall 2024, but it's time I deepened my technical expertise. This summer (2026), I'll be joining [Northrop Grumman](http://northropgrumman.com/) as a Software Engineer in their Mission Systems Sector, specifically within the Targeting & Survivability (T&S) Division. Last summer, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a Software Development Intern at [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/), where I engineered a Python state machine for chip testing under a huge neutrino experiment. This will scale to infrastructure across 6 sites and validate around 300K chips!

I've also done research work as a Research Assistant at Biola University, where I learned about multimodal authentication models (CLIP, Whisper, Sortformer) and finetuned NVIDIA NeMo for voice recognition research. When I'm not coding, you'll find me getting a good pump at the gym or playing video games (Fortnite/Brawl Stars) with my cousin!

I'm based in the Greater Chicago Area and always excited to connect with fellow developers, researchers, and anyone interested in scalable systems, AI/ML, or robotics!

## About This Website

This is my personal portfolio website—a modern, responsive single-page site built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React icons. I designed it with a minimalist, engineering-focused aesthetic that reflects my approach to software development: clean, functional, and purposeful.
